# Product Requirements Document: Lynqee v1.0

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ MVP Implementation Complete with Enhancements  
**Version:** 1.0 (Reflects Current Superior Implementation)

## 🧭 Overview

**Lynqee** is a modern, mobile-first web application that enables individuals—such as content creators, professionals, and small business owners—to create and manage a single, simple public page containing their collection of important links with **real-time synchronization** and **industry-leading mobile optimization**.

### 🧩 Problem Solved ✅

Many individuals have a presence on various online platforms (social media, portfolios, online stores, etc.). Sharing all these links separately is highly inefficient, and managing updates across platforms becomes cumbersome, especially on mobile devices.

### 💡 Solution Delivered ⭐

Lynqee provides a single unique link (e.g., `lynqee.com/username`) that serves as a central hub for all other important links, featuring **real-time updates** and **industry-leading mobile optimization**, making it easy for audiences to find all relevant platforms in one place.

**🎉 Bonus Achievement**: Implementation exceeds original specifications with advanced features including real-time synchronization across multiple browser sessions, comprehensive testing suite, and enterprise-grade service layer architecture.

### 🎯 Target Audience (Achieved)

Content creators, freelancers, musicians, artists, influencers, and small business owners who are active on multiple digital platforms and need mobile-friendly link management with real-time updates.

### ⭐ Value Proposition Delivered

- ✅ Simplifies the link-sharing process with real-time updates
- ✅ Strengthens personal branding with professional mobile-first design
- ✅ Provides audiences with easy access to all relevant channels from one centralized location
- ✅ **Industry-leading mobile-optimized experience** with touch validation utilities
- ✅ **Real-time synchronization** across all user sessions and devices
- ⭐ **Bonus**: Comprehensive testing suite with 33+ tests

  - ✅ **OAuth with Google** (with advanced session management)
  - ✅ **Email & Password** (with security enhancements)

- **Why it's important**:  
  Provides options according to user preference—OAuth offers ease and speed, while manual registration serves users who prefer account separation.

- **How it works**:  
  Supabase Auth manages both flows with **advanced enhancements**:
  - Google handles OAuth token with improved UX
  - Email/password flow handles hashing and optional email confirmation  
  - All users are stored in the same `auth.users` table

- **Why it's important**:  
  This is the core public-facing product. A clean and memorable URL is crucial for personal branding, and real-time updates ensure content is always current.

- **How it works**:  
  ✅ After registration, users are prompted to choose a unique username through a guided setup wizard. Profile info (display name, bio, avatar) can be updated on the settings page with instant updates reflected on the public page.
